# Mid-term project ‚Äî README

![](images/tiktok.jpg)

The MTP revolves around statistical charts (see [week 3](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/blob/2d4c173fabb38fb5b5f4bc1953857d4ebbeed0d6/lectureNotes/week3)).

## Description of the project 

Students ‚Äî working in groups ‚Äî are supposed:

1. to familiarize with the [TikTok Trending
Videos](https://www.kaggle.com/erikvdven/tiktok-trending-december-2020) dataset
2. to use Python to analyze the above-mentioned dataset and produce three
statistical charts that complement an article for the printed version of the New
York Times on 'what makes TikTok' videos (super-)popular
3. to produce a companion document that ‚Äî in plain English ‚Äî describes and
arguments the design choices behind the three statistical charts

## Deliverables

By Nov 16 (5:00 PM) ‚è∞ üí£, students are supposed to submit the following package:

- Python üêç code behind 2
- a companion document in .pdf format. No word limit applies; however, I really
appreciate documents with a high added value per page (see the bestseller [How
to Write Short](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Write-Short-Craft-Times-ebook/dp/B00FOQRPT4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+to+write+short&qid=1634742402&sr=8-1))
‚Äì a 10-frame slideshow that summarizes the project (needed if you're selected to
present your project to the class).

Submission will be evaluated against the assessment criteria reported in the
[README](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/blob/b5801e9afca6ba6e78bc72f99542f3adeb373415/README.md)
file of the repo.
