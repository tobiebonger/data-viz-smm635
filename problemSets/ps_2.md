# Problem set 2

Use NumPy to simulate three arrays X, Y, Z with shape (10000,). Then, Create a Matplotlib figure containing multiple charts that illustrate the univariate distribution of each array X, Y, Z & the joint distributions of the individual pairs of variables (e.g., X against Y).

Please send me your solution via email by Tue 26 (8:00 PM). Let me stress problem sets are not mandatory.
